# Maw
üî• DSLs for the DragonRuby Game Toolkit

A developing set of tools to help us DragonRuby more expressively

### What is a DSL?

A DSL is a "domain-specific language", code that helps us express
something more effectively, succinctly or intuitively

### What does Maw do?

Maw currently offers a class called **Controls** which lets you map a
set of keyboard, mouse and controller binds to a name.

Input state can then be checked by calling e.g. `controls.my_action?`, `controls.jump?`, `controls.left?`

### Using Maw

```ruby
require 'lib/maw.rb'
```

### Coming soon

Soon I will add a method `Maw!` which will activate a new ergonomic
mode for writing DragonRuby applications.

Stay tuned.

Maw is licensed under the AGPLv3. A copy of the license is available
in the root of the repository. If you find Maw useful, and wish to
deploy it in a closed source game, please contact **mooff** on Discord
